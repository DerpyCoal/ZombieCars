Hey there buddy, it seems you're snooping in my code. Just kidding, it's okay to be here.
So, let me give you some information about this place.
This is the item list. Here you can change the prices, but not what the items actually do. Obviously.

local items = {"", "+5 Damage"}
local prices = {"1", "80"}
local prices_int = {1, 80}
